# Predicting Medical Expenses Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict medical expenses based on various demographic and health-related factors. It aims to help stakeholders understand the cost drivers in healthcare and provide actionable insights for optimizing expenses.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in healthcare data
- Data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and feature engineering
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation with performance metrics

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing details such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The target variable is the medical expenses incurred by individuals.

## Results
The project demonstrates the use of regression models to predict medical expenses with high accuracy, highlighting the key predictors such as smoking status and BMI.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse samples
- Test additional machine learning algorithms
- Incorporate advanced techniques like deep learning
